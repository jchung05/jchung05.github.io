        <a href="http://rsrautobody.com">Rich's Smog &amp; Repair</a>, Fremont, CA <div style="float:right">Jan 2015 &ndash; Current</div>
        Rich's Smog &amp; Repair is uncle's automotive repair shop located near the Tesla factory in Fremont, CA. I am the webmaster and currently handle the migration from Apache 2.2 to 2.4 and have been updating the site to include interactive PHP and AJAX as well as all upkeep for future content. This site was made during the web 1.0 era, so a lot of improvements can be made. Since there is no backend to handle and no blog-esque updates there is no decision to switch to a CMS anytime soon.

        <a href="http://eatpetra.com">Petra SLO</a>, San Luis Obispo, CA <div style="float:right">May 2014 &ndash; Dec 2014</div>
        Petra is a mediterranean restaurant located in the Central Coast of California. I befriended Rammy, the restaurant owner, in an accounting class where he asked me to help him update his site. I assisted in the site redesign by helping with most of the file transfers and coding for JS and AJAX integration that is now utilized in the interactive restaurant menu.

        <a href="http://techguide.retechnology.com">RETechnology 2013 Buyer's Guide</a> <div style="float:right">Mar 2013 &ndash; Apr 2013</div>
        RETechnology is an educational platform that shows real estate agents and brokers how to use and evaluate technology to grow their business. I was part of the software team that rolled out the first interactive Buyer's Guide, a catalog of current apps and tech for users to sift through. My role was to QA parts of the project:
        <ul>
          <li>Testing the interactive HTML links</li>
          <li>QA testing the interactive PDF reader and all related, responsive functions</li>
          <li>Assisting in optimizing Piwik analytics</li>
        </ul>
